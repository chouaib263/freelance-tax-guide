## Freelancer Tax FAQ

Here are answers to the questions independent professionals ask most often about handling taxes.

---

### ‚ùì Do I need to pay taxes quarterly?

Yes‚Äîif you're not having taxes withheld automatically (like employees do), you're expected to pay estimated taxes every quarter. Deadlines vary by country (U.S., Canada, U.K.), and the guide explains them step-by-step.

---

### ‚ùì Can I write off a home office?

Yes‚Äîas long as the space is used exclusively and regularly for your business. Each country has different rules and calculation methods. Our guide includes formulas and examples for the U.S., Canada, and U.K.

---

### ‚ùì What if I work in two countries?

You may have to report foreign income, claim tax credits, or follow dual taxation treaties. The guide includes specific callouts for people working across borders or migrating.

---

### ‚ùì What happens if I miss a deadline?

Penalties apply. But there are ways to catch up, reduce interest, and request abatement. Our penalty calculator and strategy section explain it all.

---

### ‚ùì Should I hire an accountant?

That depends. If your income is simple and you're organized, filing solo is possible. But if you're unsure or earning across borders, a freelancer-savvy accountant can save you money and time.
