## Why This Guide Exists

As a freelance worker, facing taxes often means facing stress, confusion, and endless tabs open across websites that don't speak to your reality. I built this guide to change that.

This project was created by **CHOUAIB**, an independent digital builder based in Morocco, who knows the challenges of working globally, earning income across borders, and staying compliant in systems that weren’t designed with freelancers in mind.

Whether you're in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom—or anywhere life and work takes you—this guide speaks your language: clarity, simplicity, and empowerment.
