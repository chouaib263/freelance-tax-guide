## Freelance Tax Glossary

Here are simplified definitions of key tax terms that freelancers often encounter. If you ever felt confused by official language—this page is for you.

---

### 💼 Self-Employment Tax

A tax paid by freelancers and independent workers to cover Social Security and Medicare, instead of having it withheld by an employer.

---

### 🧾 Write-Off

An expense you can subtract from your income to lower your taxable amount—like software, travel, or home office costs.

---

### 📅 Estimated Payments

Quarterly tax payments made by freelancers to stay compliant and avoid penalties. You pay based on your projected income.

---

### 🌍 Foreign Income

Money earned outside your home country. May require special reporting or credit claims depending on the country.

---

### 📉 Deduction

Any item or cost that reduces your taxable income—write-offs are one type of deduction.

---

### 📋 Tax Credit

Unlike deductions, a credit reduces the amount of tax you owe directly. It’s like a discount on your tax bill.

---

### 🔎 Audit

A government review of your tax filings. It doesn’t always mean trouble—but you’ll need receipts and clarity.

---

### 📤 Filing Deadline

The date by which your tax return must be submitted. Missing it can trigger penalties.
