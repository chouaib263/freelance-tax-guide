## Privacy Policy

This site is built for independent professionals who deserve clarity—not surveillance.

Here’s what you should know:

- **No tracking tools** like Google Analytics or cookies are embedded here.
- **No personal data** is collected. You won't find forms, logins, or ads.
- **No third-party scripts** or external trackers are loaded in the background.

Your visit stays private. This guide exists to inform, not to monitor or monetize.

If you have questions about privacy, feel free to [contact me directly](mailto:zchouaib94@gmail.com).
